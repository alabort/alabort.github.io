    <p class="mt-8 mb-4 dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-blue-200 text-justify">
      I am currently in my last year as a Finance student at the Zicklin School of Business (Baruch College) and Free University of Bozen (Italy). I had the opportunity to get selected for a highly competitive program, a dual degree Masterâ€™s program in Finance and Accounting. 
      
      My previous and current work experiences in New York have provided me with detailed knowledge of financial institutions and increased my interest in pursuing a career in finance. My primary interests are Asset Management and Risk Management, but the list is still growing. If you are interested in talking about my experiences, feel free to contact me.
