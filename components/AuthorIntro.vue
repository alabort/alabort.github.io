    Let me introduce myself.

    </h3>


    <p class="mt-8 mb-4 dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-blue-200 text-justify">
    Originally from Italy, I now live in the United States pursuing a master's degree in finance at Baruch College - Zicklin School of Business. I decided to enroll in a prestigious double degree program in collaboration with the Free University of Bolzano to deepen my understanding of investments, risk management, financial markets, and institutions.

    <p class="mt-8 mb-4 dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-blue-200 text-justify">
    Analyzing and identifying opportunities for companies are the driving forces that excite me. I enjoy evaluating and forecasting a company's value. Being self-motivated and highly goal-oriented, I look forward to applying my classroom knowledge in real-world situations. I had diverse opportunities and experiences in New York that taught me resilience and increased my interest in pursuing a career in finance.

    The fields of Asset Management and Risk Management are my primary interests, however, I am open to exploring other finance areas as well. If you are interested in talking about my experiences, feel free to contact me.
